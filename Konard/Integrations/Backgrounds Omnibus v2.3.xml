			<p>Brave deeds and danger are nothing new to you. Due to the circumstances of how you were raised, you have been involved with wandering heroes for most of your life. Maybe you were part of an adventuring band previously, but split with them after a disagreement or tragedy. Or, perhaps you worked around heroes in a lesser role for most of your young life, and you are now ready to graduate to the front lines</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Athletics, Survival</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Choose one from herbalism kit, navigator’s tools, or thieves’ tools</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> 50 feet of rope, a small knife, a common monster part (such as an ore tusk or kobold claw) engraved with the name of a fellow adventurer, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>VARIANT ADVENTURER: COMMUNITY SUPPORT</h4>
			<p>Some adventurers don't have the benefit of a larger organization to back their actions, but they do have the support of their people or communities.  If this is the case, you can choose the Local Hero Feature instead of the Guild Membership feature.</p>
			<h4>VARIANT FEATURE: LOCAL HERO</h4>
			<p>Thanks to actions of you or your former adventuring party in the past, you are considered a local hero in a certain town, city, or region. While in this settlement, the locals will be willing to support you and your friends at a modest lifestyle, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will help you in reasonable ways, but will not risk their lives for you.</p>

			<p>You understand wealth, power, and privilege you just never had any of it yourself. Those with noble titles, merchant empires, and large castles need people to take care of their day-to-day affairs, and you know that life well.</p>
			<p>You lived or live your life in service to a family of middle or higher class. You are more familiar than most with the ins, outs, and back roads of the upper crust of society. Interacting with the rich and powerful has taught you much about their world and given you some keen and humble insights into human nature.</p>
			<p>Work with your DM to determine your place of service in the world and the master who you’ve served. Are you an indentured servant, working off the final years of debt to an unkind master? Do you serve your master’s family, just as your ancestors served them before you? Do you hope to rise in your position of service in the household over a number of years, or is this only temporary work for you?</p>

You are familiar with the religious rites, funerary services, and corpse treatments of most societies. Your experience often results in you having unquestioned access to unsavory places, such as crime-scenes, morgues, and cemeteries.In addition, due to the unpleasant nature of your trade you are less likely to attract scorn for possession of corpses, bones, and other normally taboo items.</p>
